# st - simple terminal
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

## Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

## Patches
All patch was saved on the `patches` directory. Installed patch:
- st-scrollback, st-scrollback-mouse, st-scrollback-mouse-altscreen
 
## Key Bindings
- scrollback: `alt + up/down`, `shift + pageup/down`, or use `mouse scroll` instead.
- font resize (zoom)
  - increase: `ctrl + plus` or `ctrl + shift + equal`
  - decrease: `ctrl + minus`
  - reset to default: `ctrl + equal`
- clipboard
  - copy: `ctrl + shift + c`
  - paste: `ctrl + shift + p`

## Installation
Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (st is installed into the `/usr/local` namespace by default). 
If you want to compile st for OpenBSD you have to remove `-lrt` from `config.mk`.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install:

    git clone https://github.com/deanvry/st
    cd st
    sudo make clean install

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

## Uninstall
If you want to uninstall st, enter the following command below:

    sudo make uninstall
